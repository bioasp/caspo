### Reasoning on the response of logical signaling networks

The manual identification of logic rules underlying a biological system is
often hard, error-prone and time consuming.
Further, it has been shown that, if the inherent experimental noise is considered, many different logical networks
can be compatible with a set of experimental observations.
Thus, automated **inference of logical networks from experimental data** would allow for
identifying admissible large-scale logic models saving a lot of efforts and without any a priori bias.
Next, once a family a logical networks has been identified, one can suggest or **design new experiments** in order to reduce the uncertainty provided by this family.
Finally, one can **look for intervention strategies** that force a set of target species or compounds into a desired steady state.
Altogether, this constitutes a pipeline for automated reasoning on logical signaling networks.
Hence, the aim of **caspo** is to implement such a pipeline providing a powerful and easy-to-use software tool for systems biologists.

{"name":"caspo","tagline":"Reasoning on the response of logical signaling networks with Answer Set Programming","body":"### Reasoning on the response of logical signaling networks\r\n\r\nThe manual identification of logic rules underlying a biological system is\r\noften hard, error-prone and time consuming. \r\nFurther, it has been shown that, if the inherent experimental noise is considered, many different logical networks\r\ncan be compatible with a set of experimental observations. \r\nThus, automated **inference of logical networks from experimental data** would allow for\r\nidentifying admissible large-scale logic models saving a lot of efforts and without any a priori bias. \r\nNext, once a family a logical networks has been identified, one can suggest or **design new experiments** in order to reduce the uncertainty provided by this family.\r\nFinally, one can **look for intervention strategies** (i.e. inclusion minimal sets of knock-ins and knock-outs) that force\r\na set of target species or compounds into a desired steady state. \r\nAltogether, this constitutes a pipeline for automated reasoning on logical signaling networks. \r\nHence, the aim of **caspo** is to implement such a pipeline providing a powerful and easy-to-use software tool for systems biologists.\r\n\r\n### Install & Usage\r\n\r\nUsually, you would install **caspo** from [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caspo) simply by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install caspo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a major re-factoring (series 2) is under development and will be released soon. For detailed instructions on how to install (pre-requisites) and use **caspo 2**, please visit the [caspo wiki](https://github.com/bioasp/caspo/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Related publications\r\n\r\n* Minimal intervention strategies in logical signaling networks with ASP.
